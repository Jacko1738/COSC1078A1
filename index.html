        <p1>Hello, I am Jack Beament and I have lived my whole life in the suburbs of Melbourne. Before attending RMIT I was a student at Thomas Carr Collage. I am partly German however do not practice any traditions or have even been to Germany. For the
            most part I enjoy the aspect of coding and up to now have been using it to develop mockup games (cookie clicker rip offs and first-person worlds) using unity and game maker. Otherwise, I am a full-time gamer and recently have been addicted
            to League of Legends and have been enjoying Binding of Isaac and Valorant.</p1>


        <h1>INTEREST IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</h1>
        <p1>As previously mentioned, I love the coding area of IT as it is like solving a puzzle each time you are required to make something and just having the ability to create something that is useful and/or be used by people. I was exposed to game maker
            in primary school and since then coding has stuck with me and inspired me to pursue a career in the area of IT. RMIT was a great choice for me as it was nearby and for the most part is in person (not this semester) where I feel I learn best
            comparted to other universities offering the same area of study but exclusively online. I expect to learn how to develop certain skills such as coding, user interface design, databases, etc. and learn how to apply them into a workplace environment.</p1>
        <h1>IDEAL JOB</h1>
        <p1>My <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/xero/76e8dee2-55e5-49c3-a260-e41e8417dca6'>ideal job</a> would be a software engineering position at a company that has an impact and has cool benefits (free coffee, slides, sleeping pods?). For example, Xero
            which helps a bunch of businesses around the world. This job will entail me to work as a team and develop interesting software that explore more into the latest technologies. Skills and qualifications, I already have for this job is basic
            coding (in python & c#) and basic teamwork, however I would need to develop my coding much further in depth and maybe learn certain new languages such as Ruby and JavaScript. A plan to acquire these skills would be to finish my Information
            Technologies course at RMIT – choosing classes directed in the software development area and doing internships at similar workplaces.
        </p1>

        </a>
        <p1>Results from these online tests conclude that I am a person who learns through examples and trying them out myself (learning style test), but have a below average creativity, however, I am quite good at abstracting concepts from ideas (creativity
            test). When in teams I would be the type of person to give directions and make sure others are doing what they are supposed to (a ‘leader’ – shown in the Myers Briggs test).

        <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>
        <img class='pic4' src="Picture4.png" alt="map_image">
        <p1>
            For my idea, the game would take place during the medieval era. There will be two castles on opposing sides of the map (one for each team). Three lanes will connect the two castles and between the lanes will be areas for the players to collect resources
            like wood and stone. After a team has collect a certain number of materials, they can build a siege weapons (for example, 1 wood and 1 stone creates a catapult) which will increase the line of attack closer towards the enemy castle; this line
            does not have any impact on the game other than the win condition – the one that reaches the enemy’s castle wins. The areas connecting the lanes allow for you to help your fellow teammates in other adjacent lanes. The combat system will heavily
            rely on skill or mechanics where certain classes will gain a slight advantage over another, for example the spear class will have a longer range and will easily land attacks on the axe class whereas the sword class can easily block the attack
            with their shield. Same with the axe class who combats the sword class as they can break their shield but weak against the spear class. However, having a class that counters your opponent does not mean a certain win as it runs down to the
            timing and order (combos) of your attacks. Different modes will be available for how long you wish the game to be. For example, the ‘normal’ mode is the full map whereas the ‘quick play’ mode is half the map and will allow for a much shorter
            game. Controls will consist of the basic controls of any MOBA where abilities are used by q, w, e and r and the mouse is used to move the character around the map. An example of the abilities of each class could be:
        </p1>
        <table class='skill_table' style="width:100%">
            <tr>
                <th>Sword & shield</th>
                <th>Axe</th>
                <th>Spear</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Q – slash</td>
                <td>Q – slash</td>
                <td>Q – slash</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>W – block (able to block any attack)</td>
                <td>W – slam (able to still to damage to sword class when used ‘W’ ability))</td>
                <td>W – spin (pushes enemies away for you)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>E – lunge</td>
                <td>E – Throw (throws axe on chain)</td>
                <td>E - stab</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>R – Rampage – constant slashing for x seconds – consistent damage </td>
                <td>R –blood rage – allows all attacks to go through sword class’ ’W’ ability and grants increased shield</td>
                <td>R – Throws spear</td>
            </tr>

        </table>

        <p1>As you can see the ‘Q’ and ‘E’ abilities are quite similar for all classes and ‘W’ and ‘R’ abilities are unique to the class, that will help counter one of the other classes. This example will obviously need to be tweaked and cooldowns and amount
            of damage has not been added yet since it will be much easier to figure out when messing around in an early stage of the game. Having these basic abilities and few classes (characters, heroes, champions) will hopefully fix the problem that
            many MOBAs have of having broken champions where skill is not a factor in winning the game which causes undesirable feelings. To develop my project idea a free game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine (most likely unity since that is what I
            am familiar with) would be useful as it provides a lot of work and resources that you would usually use to make a unique game engine for your game. Depending on how intense the game you are making in Unity the better computer you will need,
            for my idea any modern-day laptop should be able to run Unity to develop the game described in my idea. Although you may already have a laptop and able to download Unity you will still need to be able to code, especially in the language of
            C#. Coming up with a controller script to have smooth movement and fun mechanics is overall difficult. Making a multiplayer game is also a daunting task and will require knowledge of hosting, LAN, servers, etc. The possible outcome if my project
            idea if it were to become successful is that people will have a game that is fun and addicting but not have the toxic community of some similar MOBAS therefore solving the original problem of not having a fun adrenaline rush game without the
            overall ‘bm’ (bad manners) that comes with it. This will impact the MOBA community to be a much better environment.
